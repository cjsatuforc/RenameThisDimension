Date: 2014-12-15. Implemented: nope. That is all.

This implements the oft-demanded feature in the form of a button in the sketch menu.

## Usage

Select a sketch dimension, then in the Sketch panel, click Rename Dimension.

## Building

Requires Visual Studio 2017 Preview 15.6+ or so because of the use of /experimental:external.


Porting to Mac: you probably need to add extlibs to the include paths, and
that's about it.
